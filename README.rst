Django Zendesk Tickets
======================

An extensible library to add Django views with forms to submit tickets to `Zendesk`_.

Usage
-----

Add these to your ``settings.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    ZENDESK_BASE_URL = 'https://example.zendesk.com'
    ZENDESK_API_USERNAME = ...
    ZENDESK_API_TOKEN = ...
    ZENDESK_REQUESTER_ID = ...
    ZENDESK_GROUP_ID = ...

Add an entry to your urls.py

.. code-block:: python

    from zendesk_tickets.views import TicketView

    path(r'submit-ticket/$', TicketView.as_view(
        success_url='/',
        template_name='app_name/submit-ticket-page.html',
        ticket_subject='Website Feedback',
        ticket_tags=['website', 'feedback']
        ticket_template_name='app_name/feedback-ticket.txt',
    ), name='submit_ticket'),

If you wish to include additional fields, subclass ``BaseTicketForm`` and
add them. If you wish to include them in the body of the ticket, create a new
ticket template and pass it as the ``ticket_template_name``. If you wish
to include them as custom fields, define the following in your ``settings.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    ZENDESK_CUSTOM_FIELDS = {
        'referer': 31,  # zendesk field id
        'username': 32,
        'user_agent': 33,
    }

The three fields in the example above are included in ``TicketForm`` by
default and can be included in your ticket by referencing them in the ticket
template or specifying custom field ids in settings.

Please report bugs and open pull requests on `GitHub`_.

To work on changes to this library, it’s recommended to install it in editable mode into a virtual environment,
i.e. ``pip install --editable .``

Use ``python -m tests`` to run all tests locally.
Alternatively, you can use ``tox`` if you have multiple python versions.

Update translation files using ``python scripts/messages.py update``, when any localisable strings change.
Compile them using ``python scripts/messages.py compile``; this is *required* before testing and distribution.
Updating and compiling translation files requires the gettext system package to be installed.

[Only for GitHub team members] Distribute a new version to `PyPI`_ by:

- updating the ``VERSION`` tuple in ``zendesk_tickets/__init__.py``
- adding a note to the `History`_
- publishing a release on GitHub which triggers an upload to PyPI;
  alternatively, run ``python scripts/messages.py compile; python -m build; twine upload dist/*`` locally
